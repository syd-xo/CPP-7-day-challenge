### Day 2: Student Grades Analyser

**Goal:**

To create a program that collects student names and their grades, stores them in a structured format, and calculates useful statistics like average, highest, and lowest scores.
The goal is to practice using structs, arrays or vectors, and loops to process and analyze data.

---

### What I practised in Day 3
1. Creating and using structs to store related data (student name + grade).
2. Using vectors to handle dynamic collections of data.
3. Writing loops for input collection and analysis.
4. Calculating average, highest, and lowest grades.
5. Formatting numeric output using `<iomanip>` for cleaner display.
6. Strengthening my understanding of modular thinking and structured data organization.

### Notes
-  `struct` is useful when multiple values logically belong together.
- Vectors are more flexible than arrays- they can grow or shrink dynamically.
- `fixed` and `setprecision(2)` are great for controlling decimal places in output.
- Keeping input/output user-friendly (with clear prompts and separators) makes console apps feel more polished.
- Starting to see how small programs can simulate real data management tasks.

### Reflection
Today’s project felt a bit more “real”- it’s not just calculations but actual data handling.
It made me appreciate how important structuring data is, even in small programs.
At first, I was a bit unsure how structs and vectors would work together, but once I saw how clean it made the logic, it clicked.

### How to run
- Run this in the terminal.
```bash
g++ StudentGrades.cpp -o StudentGrades
