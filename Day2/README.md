### Day 2: Simple Calculator

**Goal:**  
To create a simple C++ calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. The aim of this project was to practice using functions, switch statements, and user input handling to build a modular and interactive program.

### What I Practiced in Day 2

1. **Functions**
   - declaring and defining functions to perform arithmetic operations  
   - returning values from functions  
   - understanding the importance of modularity and reusability  

2. **Switch Statements**
   - handling multiple operation choices (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
   - using `default` to catch invalid user input  

3. **Loops**
   - using a `while` loop to keep the program running until the user decides to exit  

4. **User Input and Validation**
   - taking input using `std::cin`  
   - checking for invalid operations and preventing division by zero

### Notes
- Functions make code cleaner and easier to maintain.  
- Always validate user input- especially when dividing numbers.  
- The `switch` statement is more readable than multiple `if-else` conditions when handling discrete options.  
- Using a loop allows continuous use of the calculator without restarting the program.  
- Declaring functions before `main()` and defining them afterward keeps the code organized.

### Reflection  
Todayâ€™s project taught me how to make programs more organized using functions and loops. I realized how much cleaner and more readable code becomes when logic is separated into functions instead of being written directly inside `main()`. It also gave me practice in handling user input and validating it properly.
